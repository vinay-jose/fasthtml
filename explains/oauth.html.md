# OAuth


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

OAuth is an open standard for ‘access delegation’, commonly used as a
way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their
information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. It
is the mechanism that enables “Log in with Google” on many sites, saving
you from having to remember and manage yet another password. Like many
auth-related topics, there’s a lot of depth and complexity to the OAuth
standard, but once you understand the basic usage it can be a very
convenient alternative to managing your own user accounts.

On this page you’ll see how to use OAuth with FastHTML to implement some
common pieces of functionality.

## Creating an Client

FastHTML has Client classes for managing settings and state for
different OAuth providers. Currently implemented are: GoogleAppClient,
GitHubAppClient, HuggingFaceClient and DiscordAppClient - see the
[source](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fasthtml/blob/main/nbs/api/08_oauth.ipynb)
if you need to add other providers. You’ll need a `client_id` and
`client_secret` from the provider (see the from-scratch example later in
this page for an example of registering with GitHub) to create the
client. We recommend storing these in environment variables, rather than
hardcoding them in your code.

``` python
import os
from fasthtml.oauth import GoogleAppClient
client = GoogleAppClient(os.getenv("AUTH_CLIENT_ID"),
                         os.getenv("AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"))
```

The client is used to obtain a login link and to manage communications
between your app and the OAuth provider
(`client.login_link(redirect_uri="/redirect")`).

## Using the OAuth class

Once you’ve set up a client, adding OAuth to a FastHTML app can be as
simple as:

``` python
from fasthtml.oauth import OAuth
from fasthtml.common import FastHTML, RedirectResponse

class Auth(OAuth):
    def get_auth(self, info, ident, session, state):
        email = info.email or ''
        if info.email_verified and email.split('@')[-1]=='answer.ai':
            return RedirectResponse('/', status_code=303)

app = FastHTML()
oauth = Auth(app, client)

@app.get('/')
def home(auth): return P('Logged in!'), A('Log out', href='/logout')

@app.get('/login')
def login(req): return Div(P("Not logged in"), A('Log in', href=oauth.login_link(req)))
```

There’s a fair bit going on here, so let’s unpack what’s happening in
that code:

- OAuth (and by extension our custom Auth class) has a number of default
  arguments, including some key URLs:
  `redir_path='/redirect', error_path='/error', logout_path='/logout', login_path='/login'`.
  It will create and handle the redirect and logout paths, and it’s up
  to you to handle `/login` (where unsuccessful login attempts will be
  redirected) and `/error` (for oauth errors).
- When we run `oauth = Auth(app, client)` it adds the redirect and
  logout paths to the app and also adds some beforeware. This beforeware
  runs on any requests (apart from any specified with the `skip`
  parameter).

The added beforeware specifies some app behaviour:

- If someone who isn’t logged in attempts to visit our homepage (`/`)
  here, they will be redirected to `/login`.
- If they are logged in, it calls a `check_invalid` method. This
  defaults to False, which let’s the user continue to the page they
  requested. The behaviour can be modified by defining your own
  `check_invalid` method in the Auth class - for example, you could have
  this forcibly log out users who have recently been banned.

So how does someone log in? If they visit (or are redirected to) the
login page at `/login`, we show them a login link. This sends them to
the OAuth provider, where they’ll go through the steps of selecting
their account, giving permissions etc. Once done they will be redirected
back to `/redirect`. Behind the scenes a code that comes as part of
their request gets turned into user info, which is then passed to the
key function `get_auth(self, info, ident, session, state)`. Here is
where you’d handle looking up or adding a user in a database, checking
for some condition (for example, this code checks if the email is an
answer.ai email address) or choosing the destination based on state. The
arguments are:

- `self`: the Auth object, which you can use to access the client
  (`self.cli`)
- `info`: the information provided by the OAuth provider, typically
  including a unique user id, email address, username and other
  metadata.
- `ident`: a unique identifier for this user. What this looks like
  varies between providers. This is useful for managing a database of
  users, for example.
- `session`: the current session, that you can store information in
  securely
- `state`: you can optionally pass in some state when creating the login
  link. This persists and is returned after the user goes through the
  Oath steps, which is useful for returning them to the same page they
  left. It can also be used as added security against CSRF attacks.

In our example, we check the email in `info` (we use a GoogleAppClient,
not all providers will include an email). If we aren’t happy, and
get_auth returns False or nothing (as in the case here for non-answerai
people) then the user is redirected back to the login page. But if
everything looks good we return a redirect to the homepage, and an
`auth` key is added to the session and the scope containing the users
identity `ident`. So, for example, in the homepage route we could use
`auth` to look up this particular user’s profile info and customize the
page accordingly. This auth will persist in their session until they
clear the browser cache, so by default they’ll stay logged in. To log
them out, remove it ( `session.pop('auth', None)`) or send them to
`/logout` which will do that for you.

## Explaining OAuth with a from-scratch implementation

Hopefully the example above is enough to get you started. You can also
check out the (fairly minimal) [source
code](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fasthtml/blob/main/nbs/api/08_oauth.ipynb)
where this is implemented, and the [examples
here](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fasthtml-example/blob/main/oauth_example).

If you’re wanting to learn more about how this works, and to see where
you might add additional functionality, the rest of this page will walk
through some examples **without** the OAuth convenience class, to
illustrate the concepts. This was written before said OAuth class was
available, and is kept here for educational purposes - we recommend you
stick with the new approach shown above in most cases.

## A Minimal Login Flow (GitHub)

Let’s begin by building a minimal ‘Sign in with GitHub’ flow. This will
demonstrate the basic steps of OAuth.

OAuth requires a “provider” (in this case, GitHub) to authenticate the
user. So the first step when setting up our app is to register with
GitHub to set things up.

Go to https://github.com/settings/developers and click “New OAuth App”.
Fill in the form with the following values, then click ‘Register
application’.

- Application name: Your app name
- Homepage URL: http://localhost:8000 (or whatever URL you’re using -
  you can change this later)
- Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:8000/auth_redirect (you
  can modify this later too)

<div style="text-align:center;margin:50px 0 45px;">

<img src="imgs/gh-oauth.png" alt="Setting up an OAuth app in GitHub" width="500" />

</div>

After you register, you’ll see a screen where you can view the client ID
and generate a client secret. Store these values in a safe place. You’ll
use them to create a
[`GitHubAppClient`](https://docs.fastht.ml/api/oauth.html#githubappclient)
object in FastHTML.

This `client` object is responsible for handling the parts of the OAuth
flow which depend on direct communication between your app and GitHub,
as opposed to interactions which go through the user’s browser via
redirects.

Here is how to setup the client object:

``` python
client = GitHubAppClient(
    client_id="your_client_id",
    client_secret="your_client_secret"
)
```

You should also save the path component of the authorization callback
URL which you provided on registration.

This route is where GitHub will redirect the user’s browser in order to
send an authorization code to your app. You should save only the URL’s
path component rather than the entire URL because you want your code to
work automatically in deployment, when the host and port part of the URL
change from `localhost:8000` to your real DNS name.

Save the special authorization callback path under an obvious name:

``` python
auth_callback_path = "/auth_redirect"
```

<div>

> It’s recommended to store the client ID, and secret, in environment
> variables, rather than hardcoding them in your code.

</div>

When the user visit a normal page of your app, if they are not already
logged in, then you’ll want to redirect them to your app’s login page,
which will live at the `/login` path. We accomplish that by using this
piece of “beforeware”, which defines logic which runs before other work
for all routes except ones we specify to be skipped:

``` python
def before(req, session):
    auth = req.scope['auth'] = session.get('user_id', None)
    if not auth: return RedirectResponse('/login', status_code=303)
    counts.xtra(name=auth)
bware = Beforeware(before, skip=['/login', auth_callback_path])
```

We configure the beforeware to skip `/login` because that’s where the
user goes to login, and we also skip the special authorization callback
path because that is used by OAuth itself to receive information from
GitHub.

It’s only at your login page that we start the OAuth flow. To start the
OAuth flow, you need to give the user a link to GitHub’s login for your
app. You’ll need the `client` object to generate that link, and the
client object will in turn need the full authorization callback URL,
which we need to build from the authorization callback path, so it is a
multi-step process to produce this GitHub login link.

Here is an implementation of your own `/login` route handler. It
generates the GitHub login link and presents it to the user:

``` python
@app.get('/login')
def login(request)
    redir = redir_url(request,auth_callback_path)
    login_link = client.login_link(redir)
    return P(A('Login with GitHub', href=login_link))    
```

Once the user follows that link, GitHub will ask them to grant
permission to your app to access their GitHub account. If they agree,
GitHub will redirect them back to your app’s authorization callback URL,
carrying an authorization code which your app can use to generate an
access token. To receive this code, you need to set up a route in
FastHTML that listens for requests at the authorization callback path.
For example:

``` python
@app.get(auth_callback_path)
def auth_redirect(code:str):
    return P(f"code: {code}")
```

This authorization code is temporary, and is used by your app to
directly ask the provider for user information like an access token.

To recap, you can think of the exchange so far as:

- User to us: “I want to log in with you, app.”
- Us to User: “Okay but first, here’s a special link to log in with
  GitHub”
- User to GitHub: “I want to log in with you, GitHub, to use this app.”
- GitHub to User: “OK, redirecting you back to the app’s URL (with an
  auth code)”
- User to Us: “Hi again, app. Here’s the GitHub auth code you need to
  ask GitHub for info about me” (delivered via
  `/auth_redirect?code=...`)

The final steps we need to implement are as follows:

- Us to GitHUb: “A user just gave me this auth code. May I have the user
  info (e.g., an access token)?”
- GitHub to us: “Since you have an auth code, here’s the user info”

It’s critical for us to derive the user info from the auth code
immediately in the authorization callback, because the auth code may be
used only once. So we use it that once in order to get information like
an access token, which will remain valid for longer.

To go from the auth code to user info, you use
`info = client.retr_info(code,redirect_uri)`. From the user info, you
can extract the `user_id`, which is a unique identifier for the user:

``` python
@app.get(auth_callback_path)
def auth_redirect(code:str, request):
    redir = redir_url(request, auth_callback_path)
    user_info = client.retr_info(code, redir)
    user_id = info[client.id_key]
    return P(f"User id: {user_id}")
```

But we want the user ID not to print it but to remember the user.

So let us store it in the `session` object, to remember who is logged
in:

``` python
@app.get(auth_callback_path)
def auth_redirect(code:str, request, session):
    redir = redir_url(request, auth_callback_path)
    user_info = client.retr_info(code, redir)
    user_id = user_info[client.id_key] # get their ID
    session['user_id'] = user_id # save ID in the session
    return RedirectResponse('/', status_code=303)
```

The session object is derived from values visible to the user’s browser,
but it is cryptographically signed so the user can’t read it themselves.
This makes it safe to store even information we don’t want to expose to
the user.

For larger quantities of data, we’d want to save that information in a
database and use the session to hold keys to lookup information from
that database.

Here’s a minimal app that puts all these pieces together. It uses the
user info to get the user_id. It stores that in the session object. It
then uses the user_id as a key into a database, which tracks how
frequently every user has hit an increment button.

``` python
import os
from fasthtml.common import *
from fasthtml.oauth import GitHubAppClient, redir_url

db = database('data/counts.db')
counts = db.t.counts
if counts not in db.t: counts.create(dict(name=str, count=int), pk='name')
Count = counts.dataclass()

# Auth client setup for GitHub
client = GitHubAppClient(os.getenv("AUTH_CLIENT_ID"), 
                         os.getenv("AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"))
auth_callback_path = "/auth_redirect"

def before(req, session):
    # if not logged in, we send them to our login page
    # logged in means:
    # - 'user_id' in the session object, 
    # - 'auth' in the request object
    auth = req.scope['auth'] = session.get('user_id', None)
    if not auth: return RedirectResponse('/login', status_code=303)
    counts.xtra(name=auth)
bware = Beforeware(before, skip=['/login', auth_callback_path])

app = FastHTML(before=bware)

# User asks us to Login
@app.get('/login')
def login(request):
    redir = redir_url(request,auth_callback_path)
    login_link = client.login_link(redir)
    # we tell user to login at github
    return P(A('Login with GitHub', href=login_link))    

# User comes back to us with an auth code from Github
@app.get(auth_callback_path)
def auth_redirect(code:str, request, session):
    redir = redir_url(request, auth_callback_path)
    user_info = client.retr_info(code, redir)
    user_id = user_info[client.id_key] # get their ID
    session['user_id'] = user_id # save ID in the session
    # create a db entry for the user
    if user_id not in counts: counts.insert(name=user_id, count=0)
    return RedirectResponse('/', status_code=303)

@app.get('/')
def home(auth):
    return Div(
        P("Count demo"),
        P(f"Count: ", Span(counts[auth].count, id='count')),
        Button('Increment', hx_get='/increment', hx_target='#count'),
        P(A('Logout', href='/logout'))
    )

@app.get('/increment')
def increment(auth):
    c = counts[auth]
    c.count += 1
    return counts.upsert(c).count

@app.get('/logout')
def logout(session):
    session.pop('user_id', None)
    return RedirectResponse('/login', status_code=303)

serve()
```

Some things to note:

- The `before` function is used to check if the user is authenticated.
  If not, they are redirected to the login page.
- To log the user out, we remove the user ID from the session.
- Calling `counts.xtra(name=auth)` ensures that only the row
  corresponding to the current user is accessible when responding to a
  request. This is often nicer than trying to remember to filter the
  data in every route, and lowers the risk of accidentally leaking data.
- In the `auth_redirect` route, we store the user ID in the session and
  create a new row in the `user_counts` table if it doesn’t already
  exist.

You can find more heavily-commented version of this code in the [oauth
directory in
fasthtml-example](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fasthtml-example/tree/main/oauth_example),
along with an even more minimal example. More examples may be added in
the future.

### Revoking Tokens (Google)

When the user in the example above logs out, we remove their user ID
from the session. However, the user is still logged in to GitHub. If
they click ‘Login with GitHub’ again, they’ll be redirected back to our
site without having to log in again. This is because GitHub remembers
that they’ve already granted our app permission to access their account.
Most of the time this is convenient, but for testing or security
purposes you may want a way to revoke this permission.

As a user, you can usually revoke access to an app from the provider’s
website (for example, <https://github.com/settings/applications>). But
as a developer, you can also revoke access programmatically - at least
with some providers. This requires keeping track of the access token
(stored in `client.token["access_token"]` after you call `retr_info`),
and sending a request to the provider’s revoke URL:

``` python
auth_revoke_url = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/revoke"
def revoke_token(token):
    response = requests.post(auth_revoke_url, params={"token": token})
    return response.status_code == 200 # True if successful
```

Not all providers support token revocation, and it is not built into
FastHTML clients at the moment.

### Using State (Hugging Face)

Imagine a user (not logged in) comes to your AI image editing site,
starts testing things out, and then realizes they need to sign in before
they can click “Run (Pro)” on the edit they’re working on. They click
“Sign in with Hugging Face”, log in, and are redirected back to your
site. But now they’ve lost their in-progress edit and are left just
looking at the homepage! This is an example of a case where you might
want to keep track of some additional state. Another strong use case for
being able to pass some uniqie state through the OAuth flow is to
prevent something called a [CSRF
attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery). To
add a state string to the OAuth flow, include a `state` argument when
creating the login link:

``` python
# in login page:
link = A('Login with GitHub', href=client.login_link(state='current_prompt: add a unicorn'))

# in auth_redirect:
@app.get('/auth_redirect')
def auth_redirect(code:str, session, state:str=None):
    print(f"state: {state}") # Use as needed
    ...
```

The state string is passed through the OAuth flow and back to your site.
